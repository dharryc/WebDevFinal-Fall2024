# Final Project Fall 2024
### -Harry Cook

I have a pretty simple idea for my final project, but it's one that I'm really excited for and really looking forward to implimenting. My family always has a hard time trying to figure out what to get each other for christmas and birthdays without stepping on each others toes. It's hard to get a good list, and it's hard to make sure that other people can see the most up to date list.\
To *hopefully* make this easier, I want to make a website that I can share with my family. Each family member will make a username and password, as well as have a "displayed name" that other users can see. When you log in, you will have access to your page, where you can edit links and images of products you want. In addition, you can add little notes to each of your "wished items," including links, specifications, or prioritization levels (maybe even a slider so you can change priority levels).\
In addition, you will be able to access a bigger list that gives you access to everyone else's wish lists, with additional features, such as an option to mark an item with a purchased tag, mark something as willing to "pitch in on," or mark something as waiting for it to go on sale or something like that.\
Now, I don't think this is going to be easy, but I do think that it's something I'm excited about, and it's something I'd really like to get working for this holiday season.

     - [X] Create HTML and CSS layout for site
     - [X] User can add an item on a list
     - [X] Use basic layout made in this step to make static site generator
* Nov 16 (30%)
    - [ ] Impliment user creation page with validation
    - [ ] Impliment C# API that is able to create and delete users with properly linked items
    - [ ] User can see their own list on a page (add and remove)
* Nov 20 (45%)
    - [ ] Tie API to site so that it is dynamically updatable and usable (SO MUCH JS)
* Nov 23 (60%)
    - [ ] Other users can mark items as purchased
    - [ ] User can't see items that have been bought for them
    - [ ] Add countdown timers for upcoming events (christmas, birthdays, etc.)
* Nov 26 (75%)
    - [ ] Host site on cloud (research and find out how well that will work)
    - [ ] Host HTML/CSS/JS on non git server
* Dec 4 (90%)
    - [ ] Impliment abiltiy for users to add a picture for item description
    - [ ] Make "shopping cart" so you can estimate how much a given set of gifts would cost without pulling up a calculator

In order to get the required 25 points for the hard parts of the project, my first plan is to use:
* Back end API (15pts)
* Host API on cloud server (10pts)

This already gets me to the required 25 points, however, in addition, I plan to use:
* Uploading, storing, and using files on a custom api (15pts)
* Work with audio / video files (8pts)
* Make it mobile responsive (8pts)
* Typescript (10pts)
* And, though ambitious, I hope to write a static site generator (provided I actually understand what that means, 25pts)

These combined get me another 62 points, which should be PLENTY.

Honestly, I'm really excited for this assignment. I think it's going to be really cool to impliment a simple but professional looking site running for my family. I think it will provide useful services to my family, and as time goes on, I'll be able to keep updating it to make it better with every class I take.
